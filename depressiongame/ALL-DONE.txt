*The City* CONFIDENCE
While the player goes to the city, suddenly he feels something different..

you: *Suddenly, the heart swelled rapidly* Why is it like this? I'm feeling some presence of enemies...

When the player got into the city, he saw some people that seem to be nervous and doesn't want to talk to him..

you: How are you? Can I ask for some water?

Person 1: ....

you: I travelled so far so I was really thirsty...

Person 2: ...

The player notice that the people aren't talking and didnt' welcome him when he arrive...

As he thinks deeply, a little girl is approaching to him with a glass of water...

little girl: Here is a cold and fresh water, I myself did get it from the well..

you: Thank you, little girl. May I ask? Why are the people in here aren't talking and seemed to be mad?

People: Why, what happened to you before?

you: I was once like you, always feeling nervous and not talking to anybody. But then I learned that if you let your anxiety eat you, you will be more depressed and vulnerable to the ability to deal with people.

People: Thank you for sharing your story and your experience. That helped us.

(Refuse the quest)
you: I'm sorry I don't think I have the confidence to do what you expect me to do..

People: But why would you lose your confidence if your mission is to help others?

People: Change yourself, Look around you. There are so many lives that needs you. If you don't change, then how long will you be?

you: I tried it already but it doesn't work. Please stop asking for help because I can't really do it.
